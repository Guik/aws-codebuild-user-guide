# AWS Lambda sample for CodeBuild<a name="sample-lambda"></a>

The AWS Serverless Application Model \(AWS SAM\) is an open\-source framework for building serverless applications\. For more information, see the [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) repository on GitHub\.

You can use AWS CodeBuild to package and deploy serverless applications that follow the AWS SAM standard\. For the deployment step, CodeBuild can use AWS CloudFormation\. To automate the building and deployment of serverless applications with CodeBuild and AWS CloudFormation, you can use AWS CodePipeline\.

For more information, see [Deploying Lambda\-based Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\. To experiment with a serverless application sample that uses CodeBuild along with AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFormation, and CodePipeline, see [Automating Deployment of Lambda\-based Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/automating-deployment.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.
